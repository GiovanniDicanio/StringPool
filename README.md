# StringPool
Custom C++ String Pool Allocator, including benchmark code to compare vs. STL strings.

by Giovanni Dicanio

Reusable code can be found in the [`StringPool.h` header](https://github.com/GiovanniDicanio/StringPool/blob/master/StringPool/StringPool/StringPool.h).

This repo constains a VS2015 solution; anyway, I wrote the C++ code to be _cross-platform_ (e.g. there are no dependencies from `<Windows.h>` or other Windows-specific headers).
